# CrossFit Open 2023 Athletes Performance Analysis

CrossFit is a fitness regimen brand developed and founded by Greg Glassman in 2000. It involves cross-disciplinary movements often performed at high intensity. Over the past two decades, CrossFit became a fitness methodology that was exponentially adopted worldwide. Since 2007, athletes of all levels have been welcomed to participate in an annual competition called the CrossFit Games. To qualify for the CrossFit Games, athletes go through a series of qualification phases. The first phase is called the CrossFit Open (The Open). The Open is a series of weekly workouts that need to be performed as prescribed (Rx’d) to qualify for the next round, the Quarterfinals.

The objectives of this project are as follows:

Based on the Open 2023, we will evaluate the athletes’ profile, such as their age, height, weight, gender, and their benchmark scores (if entered in their profile) to determine how well they would have performed at each test in 2023. We will use regression to understand how each variable of an athlete’s profile would impact their scores.

CrossFit is a multidisciplinary sport that touches many fitness areas, mainly gymnastics, Olympic weightlifting, and cardiovascular endurance. For CrossFit newcomers, with prior athletic experience, we would also want to know how well they would have performed in the Open 2023 tests. As such, we will use predictive modeling to evaluate their potential and if they would have qualified for the next round.
